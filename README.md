Hi, I'm Michael! I am a fifth-year undergraduate at Cal Poly majoring in Computer Science, with minors in philosophy and math.

I'm passionate about Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Machine Learning. Recently, I've been particularly interested in cybersecurity due to current events as well as conversations I've had with industry professionals. 

During my time at Cal Poly, I've adoped our "Learn by Doing" lifestyle and have worked on various computer science related projects. These have included, but are not limited to: 
  (1) GAEIA Team Web Application
  (2) Senior Project: Employing various Machine Learning models to analyze historical NBA statistics
  (3) Compiler for Mini, a subset of the C Programming Language
  (4) Lightweight Thread Library for an Operating System

After graduation, I'm excited to find a role in industry where I can continue to challenge myself, learn, and grow.
