Hi, I'm Michael! 

A a fifth-year undergraduate at Cal Poly, I'm close to finishing my degree in computer science, with minors in philosophy and math.

I'm passionate about cybersecurity, software engineering, and machine learning. I love chatting with people in industry to hear more about their responsibilities within these fields! 

During my time at Cal Poly, I've adoped our "Learn by Doing" lifestyle and have worked on various computer science related projects. Some of my favorites have been:

  (1) GAEIA Web Application

  (2) Compiler for Mini, a subset of the C Programming Language
  
  (3) Support for Lightweight Processes, a thread library in C
  
  (4) Open Recipes, a mobile app for browsing and saving personalized recipes

After graduation, I'm excited to find a role in industry where I can continue to challenge myself and grow, both personally and professionally!
